## Business Task

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## Solutions 
### Q1: What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
<details>

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(price) AS total_amount_spent FROM sales s
JOIN menu ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
````

- I used the SUM and GROUP BY to figure out the total_amount_spent that each customer spent
- Used a JOIN to combine the sales and menu table on product_id that are from both tables
- Ended with an ORDER BY on customer_id to get an ascending table

### Q2: How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
<details>

````sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) as days_visited FROM sales s
GROUP BY customer_id
````
<br>

- I used COUNT on the order_date to get each entry for the order_date, and DISTINCT to remove the duplicates of the same dates
- Finished with GROUP BY to get the customers in ascending order

### Q3: What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
<details>

````sql
  with t1 as(
	SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name, 
	ROW_Number() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
	ORDER BY s.order_date) as rank
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name FROM t1
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name
````
  
- Use t1 as a temporary table and use ROW_Number to create column ranks that is partitioned by the customer_id and ORDERED BY order_date
- Write new query pulling the customer_id and product_name from t1 table WHERE the rank = 1, which will pull the rank 1 entry for each customer_id
- GROUP BY customer_id and product_name to fetch the customer_id and first item ever ordered by the customer

### Q4: What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
<details>

````sql
SELECT product_name, COUNT(s.product_id) AS most_purchased FROM sales s
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
GROUP BY product_name, s.product_id
ORDER BY most_purchased DESC
````

- Use COUNT of product_id 
- GROUP BY the product_id and product_name to show all the products and the amount of times they were each purchased
- ORDER BY most_purchased DESC to get the highest to lowest

### Q5: Which item was the most popular for each customer?
<details>

````sql
	with t1 as (
	SELECT customer_id, product_name, COUNT(m.product_id) AS order_count,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id 
					ORDER BY COUNT(s.customer_id) DESC) AS rank 
	FROM sales s
	JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
	GROUP BY customer_id, product_name
	ORDER BY customer_id, rank DESC
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_count FROM t1
WHERE rank = 1
````
- Use t1 as a temp table and use DENSE_RANK so the tied numbers are not skipped over
- Fetch data WHERE the rank = 1 to show the most popular item for each customer

### Q6: Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
<details>
	
````sql
with t1 as (
	SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
					 ORDER BY s.order_date) AS rank
	FROM sales s
	JOIN members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
	WHERE s.order_date >= m.join_date
)

SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name FROM t1 s
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY customer_id
````
- Use a temp table t1
- Use DENSE_RANK and partition by customer id, and then ORDER BY the order_date AS rank to get a ranking on the order dates
- JOIN and use WHERE on order date with a greater than or equal to the join_date to get only entries starting from the join_date
- Use a rank = 1 and to get the top rank for each customer_id

### Q7: Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
<details>

````sql
with t1 as (
	SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
	ROW_Number() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
					 ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rank
	FROM sales s
	JOIN members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
	WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
)

SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name FROM t1 s
JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY customer_id
````
- Very similar to Question 6, make sure to DESC the ORDER BY  on s.order_date so that it gives the most recent orders right before the join_date
- Flip the greater than equal sign to a less than sign on WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date so that you can fetch all the orders before the join_date

### Q8: What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
<details>

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(s.product_id) AS menu_item,
SUM(mm.price) as total_sales FROM sales s
JOIN members m ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
JOIN menu mm ON s.product_id = mm.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id
ORDER BY s.customer_id
````

- Use a COUNT DISTINCT on product_id and SUM the total_sales before becoming a member
- Use a filter on order_date less than the join date to get all the entries before each customer became a member
